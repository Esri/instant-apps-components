# Instant Apps Components React

A set of React components that wrap [Instant Apps Components](https://github.com/Esri/instant-apps-components).

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save @esri/instant-apps-components-react
```

This package includes the compatible version of the main component library as a dependency, so no need to install `@esri/instant-apps-components` separately.

Once installed, you need to import each component you use from the standard `instant-apps-component` package's custom elements build. This will automatically define the custom elements on the window. Then import the same components from `instant-apps-components-react`.

```jsx
import "@esri/instant-apps-components/dist/components/instant-apps-header";
import "@esri/instant-apps-components/dist/components/instant-apps-social-share";
import { InstantAppsHeader, InstantAppsSocialShare } from "@esri/instant-apps-components-react";
```

## Why not just use the web components directly?

Because React uses a synthetic event system, the custom events emitted from instant apps components won't work with JSX in React.

If you're using TypeScript, you'll also get increased type safety for your event listeners, props, etc.
