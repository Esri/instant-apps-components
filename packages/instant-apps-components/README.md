# Instant Apps Components

Instant Apps Components, is a library of [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) (Custom Elements) built with [StencilJS](https://stenciljs.com/), with the purpose of being utilized by [ArcGIS Instant Apps](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-instant-apps/overview). Web Components are browser-compatible elements, use native browser APIs, resuable, and contain encapsulated functionality. Instant Apps Components use [Calcite Components](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-components), the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/), and additional functionality that can be easily implemented into your web map applications. While this library of web components are intended for being used in ArcGIS Instant Apps, these components can be used in any web map application, without being tied to a particular library or framework.

## Setting up the components in your project:

### Managing assets:

In order for the library to work properly, you'll need to copy the assets to the root of your project.

For example:

`ncp node_modules/@esri/instant-apps-components/dist/assets public/assets`

### Importing the components:

In your entry file (index.ts), simply import the component(s) into your project.

For example:

```
import "@esri/instant-apps-components/dist/components/instant-apps-header";
import "@esri/instant-apps-components/dist/components/instant-apps-social-share";
```
