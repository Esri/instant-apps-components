# instant-apps-measurement

## Description
 
 The `instant-apps-measurement` component is a tool that is used in apps to calculate measurements for distance, area and coordinates in a map or scene view. 

The measurement tool consists of four tools in the component: 
- **Distance measurement**: Determines and displays the distance between two or more points in the view
- **Area measurement**: Calculates and displays the area and perimeter of a polygon in the view
- **Coordinate conversion**: Measures the coordinates of a point in the view and provides additional formats to convert the coordinate to 
- **Clear measurement**: Used to clear any existing measurements calculated using the tools in the component
