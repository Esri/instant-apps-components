## Overview

The `instant-apps-app-guide` is a component containing a page(s) that describes features of a tool or Instant App.

Data for the pages is passed as an array of `AppGuidePage` objects that each have the following properties:
- `title`: The title of the page; this will be displayed in the header if the `header` prop is set to true or the `header` attribute is present
- `content`: An array of strings that represent the content items on the page
- `type`: How the content items should be rendered. The default is 'paragraphs', but 'list' is also available for rendering as a numbered list.
